then open regedit, go to the folder H_Key_Current_User\Software\Cygames\PrincessConnectRedive
and search for and delete the following two strings:
M3F1YSNkOnF0_h4073495316
MHx5cg==_h786395497
do this after you sign in with the new account but before you launch the game again
this will delete the account stored on the computer without deleting the game itself
